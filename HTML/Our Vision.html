            <h1>About Educonet</h1>
            <p class="lead">Educonet transforms the university campus into a living talent marketplace where students can teach, learn, and earn from one another. The platform connects students who want to share their skills with those eager to learn them, creating opportunities that are both practical and affordable.

From coding and photography to music and business tools, Educonet empowers students to turn their knowledge into income and their curiosity into growth. It encourages entrepreneurship, collaboration, and self-improvement within the student community.

Educonet is more than a platform; it is a movement that promotes independence, confidence, and creativity among students. By helping learners become teachers and turning talent into opportunity, Educonet is building a culture of empowerment at the University of Johannesburg..</p>
